## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

First of all, I apologize because I don't know the flow of how to play pokemon because I don't follow the game or the pokemon movie itself.

This project is a pokemon battle royale game where 5 pokemon will compete at once, in this project also records every match log and can be retrieved at any time and within a certain period.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

- Rename .env.example file to .env
- Configuration database in .env file
```
DB_HOST= //Database Host
DB_PORT= //Database Port
DB_NAME= //Database Name
DB_USERNAME= //Database Username
DB_PASSWORD= //Database Password
```
Don't worry, you don't need to create a table for this application because this application will automatically create a table by itself. Just make sure your database is connected correctly.
